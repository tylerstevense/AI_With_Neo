Neo, the "MALE" AI-ChatBot in Android Application 


Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant all are female...even the JIO chatbot.
Now it's the time form girls to get a boy as the assistant. Here is the handsome n smart "***Neo***", ready for you, the pretty!!

*Simsimi API< <http://developer.simsimi.com/> >has been used for the implementation of the ChatBot. *

The code is fully functional. For the users they have to go **app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml** after opening the project on Android Studio and paste the generated API key after being signed in on the prementioned link. For free trial it'll provide only 100 calls per day for one week. 

Just for Learning n Testing :P
